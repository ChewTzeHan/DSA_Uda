The function initially uses quicksort to sort the input list. Quicksort has a time complexity of O(n log n).

Afterwards, the input list is iterated once through all its values to add to the 2 sums, a time complexity of O(n).

O(n log n) + O(n) = O(n log n)

Thus the time complexity is O(n log n)


The space complexity is O(1) as there are no additional data structures used that change based on input size. The same input list is used before and after sorting for a constant space ecomplexity.
