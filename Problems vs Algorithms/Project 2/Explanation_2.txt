The initial pivot is found using binary search, which has a time complexity of O(log n)

Afterwards, the index of the given input number is again searched using binary search using an array seperated by the pivot, another O(log n)

O(log n) + O(log n) = O(2log n), rounded to O(log n)

Thus the time complexity is O(log n).


The space complexity is O(1) as there are no additional data structures used in the function that will change depending on the input size.
